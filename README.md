# Shake 'em Up

## Overview

Shake 'Em Up hopes to be a dice rolling app that allows a selection of a wide variety of dice. On the "Roll" tab you can select up to 6 dice (hopefully more in the future), shake the phone and get back the result of your throw (with a total of all of the dice). Dice rolls should be stored in the "History" tab showing the result of previous dice throws and their total.

If time allows I'd like to put interesting statistics on the Home area showing:
- The total number of throws (total and by dice type)
- The total number of dice thrown (total and by dice type)
- The total of all dice throws in the history
